# Cura_cahnge_Mesh-Bed-Values-post-process
I wrote a script for the post-processing function in cura.
You can change every point from the Mesh. YOU NEED to have a mesh bed. (Marlin-Mesh bed leveling). The Plugin inculde 25 points. So it's for a mesh bed leveling with 25 points created.

IMPORTANT:
YOU NEED TO WRITE "PLUS" or "MINUS"
for example: +0.05 or -0.05
if you only use the value 0.05 (without "-" or "+"), the mesh point will be set to the value.

You have also two optional features:

One Value for all point
Save it in the EPPROM
Option 1: If you enable the "Same Value" checkbox, it's enough when you insert one Value for all points.

Option 2: If you enable the "Save to EPPROM" checkbox, the settings will be save in the EPPROM. (If EPPROM is in the firmware enabled)
